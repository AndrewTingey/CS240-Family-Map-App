    {
        Create your Main Activity class (see the Family Map specification for details on Main Activity).

        Create your Login Fragment class including all of its GUI components (see the Family Map specification for more details on Login Fragment).

        Embed your Login Fragment in your Main Activity’s GUI.

        When the user clicks the “SIGN IN” button, create a background task that uses HttpURLConnection to send a login request to the Family Map server.

        If the login request fails, display an Android toast indicating that the login failed.

        If the login request succeeds, use the HttpURLConnection again to retrieve the logged-in user’s family data from the server. When the family data is received, display an Android toast containing the logged-in user’s first and last names.

        Repeat steps 5 – 7 for new user registration and the “REGISTER” button.

        Pass off your login/register functionality with a TA.
