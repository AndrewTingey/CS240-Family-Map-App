Login assignment
    Share code between intellij and here

    {
        Create your Main Activity class (see the Family Map specification for details on Main Activity).

        Create your Login Fragment class including all of its GUI components (see the Family Map specification for more details on Login Fragment).

        Embed your Login Fragment in your Main Activity’s GUI.

        When the user clicks the “SIGN IN” button, create a background task that uses HttpURLConnection to send a login request to the Family Map server.

        If the login request fails, display an Android toast indicating that the login failed.

        If the login request succeeds, use the HttpURLConnection again to retrieve the logged-in user’s family data from the server. When the family data is received, display an Android toast containing the logged-in user’s first and last names.

        Repeat steps 5 – 7 for new user registration and the “REGISTER” button.

        Pass off your login/register functionality with a TA.
    }

    use SwitchFragmentExample project using MainActivity, LoginFragment, RegisterFragment

TODO:
    logic for onGenderButtonClicked() should be in Login.java, rn its in MainActivity.java
    That stuff^

Notes from class:
    Use a thread from the login fragment to call the serverProxy class to access the internet
    create thread form UI thread using java.util.concurrent package
    Create handler class: background_tasks.pptx.20
    Call the tasks from the buttons with the handler

Latest:
    after loggin in,
    use the http commands /event, /user and /user/ownID
    cache the data of the first two and display first/last name on a toast
