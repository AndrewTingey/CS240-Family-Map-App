Notes from class 3/28:
    you can make a view scrollable by nesting the layout in a scrollview .xml
    how do you make enter take the user to the next editText view

    Map fragment - relative view
    Search fragment - linear view
    settings fragment - linear view with linear and relative within
    person details fragment - linear layout with expandable view in bottom
        (you can use a empty view between to set a line)

    After leaving settings, call GoogleMap.clear() and reload lines and markers
